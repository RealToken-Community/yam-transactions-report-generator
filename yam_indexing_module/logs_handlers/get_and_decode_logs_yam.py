YAM Contract Event Decoder

This module provides functions for fetching and decoding event logs from YAM smart contracts
on the blockchain. It handles four types of events:
- OfferCreated
- OfferDeleted
- OfferAccepted
- OfferUpdated

All event decoders follow a common pattern:
- Extract data from the event topics and data field
- Structure the data into a dictionary specific to the event type
- Add common blockchain metadata using _get_generic_data_logs()

Usage Example:
    # Fetch raw logs from the blockchain
    raw_logs = get_raw_logs_yam(w3, contract_address, from_block, to_block)
    
    # Decode the logs into structured dictionaries
    decoded_logs = decode_raw_logs_yam(raw_logs)

Return Data Structure:
    Each decoded event is returned as a dictionary. All dictionaries contain some common keys,
    while others are specific to certain event types. Here is a comprehensive list of all
    possible keys that may appear in the returned dictionaries:
    
    Common keys (present in all event types):
    - topic: String indicating the event type ('OfferCreated', 'OfferDeleted', 'OfferAccepted', 'OfferUpdated')
    - transactionHash: String
    - logIndex: Integer
    - blockNumber: Integer
    - offerId: Integer
    
    Keys specific to OfferCreated and OfferAccepted events:
    - seller: String
    - buyer: String
    - price: Integer
    - amount: Integer
    - offerToken: String
    - buyerToken: String
    
    Keys specific to OfferUpdated events:
    - oldPrice: Integer
    - oldAmount: Integer
    - newPrice: Integer
    - newAmount: Integer
    
    OfferDeleted events only contain the common keys listed above.
